My init file for emacs.

. Add MELPA package repository by default.
. Introduce amazing `use-package` facility which greatly simplifies the further config.
. For Common Lisp development: 
.. Slime
.. Paredit
.. Evil + Evil-Paredit
.. Rainbow Delimiters
.. Redshank
.. EMR
. For Web development:
.. SKewer-mode
.. js2-mode
.. web-mode
. Go to Definition and Autocomplete:
.. projectile
.. helm
.. helm-projectile
. Flycheck
. `adoc-mode` because for development articles I write now exclusively in Asciidoc.
. Special set of customizations so that Emacs will be integrated with X clipboard.
. Make F2 work as amazingly simple terminal launcher
. Visual changes:
.. No beeping (thank you God)
.. No toolbar
.. No startup screen or scratch buffer message, by default open blank scratch buffer.
.. Zenburn theme
.. Show line and column numbers in modeline.
.. Scrollbar to the right, not left.
. Organizational changes:
.. Everything inside `.emacs.d`, can migrate easily if needed.
.. Recent file history enabled.
.. Last visited buffers are remembered using `desktop-save-mode` feature.
.. Everything except window splitting settings is saved between launches of Emacs.
